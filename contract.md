# Contract Grades – “A” Contract

I, Eric Stone, agree to :

1)  Earn “Satisfactory” on 10 self-paced lab assignments on the schedule
    specified below.
    - Satisfactory defined:
    - I have attempted all steps of the assignment. If unable to
      complete steps due to unresolved questions, I have asked questions
      in Github FAQs or zoom help session, or I have Googled the issue
      and shown effort to resolve questions;
    - I have checked that forked files, repos, or projects appear on my
      Github account and are accessible;
    - I feel like I have spent an adequate amount of time and energy on
      assignments;
2)  Produce at least 3 “Satisfactory” portfolio pieces on the schedule
    specified below.

## SCHEDULE

Note: This is a draft. Feedback welcome and appreciated! I chose modules
based on how the names sounded, but I am not certain those are the best
choices. Please feel free to suggest additions and subtractions based on
your knowledge of my interests. The only clear constraint is finishing
this course by the end of March, as I will be leaving for a variety of
trips starting in April. I left some time after the completion of the
course to discussion simulations.
